Intro.txt: (Stream&Buffers):
1. What is a Buffer?
    A Buffer is a temporary memory location in Node.js.
    Used to store raw binary data (0s and 1s) when transferring between processes.
    Example: when you read a file, data is first stored in a Buffer before being processed.

Example: Creating a Buffer:
// Create a buffer with a string
const buf = Buffer.from('Hello Node.js');
console.log(buf);         // Prints binary data <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f ...>
console.log(buf.toString()); // Convert buffer back to string

2. What is a Stream?
    A Stream is like a pipeline that lets you read/write data piece by piece instead of loading the whole file at once.
    Good for large files (videos, logs, etc.).
    Streams work with Buffers internally.

    👉 Think of it like a water pipe:
    Buffer = the water tank storing chunks.
    Stream = the pipe that controls the flow of water.

3. Types of Streams:
    (i) Readable Stream → For reading data (e.g., file read).
    (ii) Writable Stream → For writing data (e.g., file write).
    (iii) Duplex Stream → Both read and write (e.g., network sockets).
    (iv) Transform Stream → Modify data while streaming (e.g., compression).
