Passport.js Authentication in Express JS:
    Passport.js is an authentication middleware for Node.js applications, mainly used with Express JS. It helps developers authenticate users easily and securely.
    Authentication means verifying who the user is. For example, when a user logs in using a username and password, the system checks whether the details are correct. Passport.js handles this process for you.
    Passport.js works using different authentication strategies. A strategy defines how a user will log in. Common strategies include Local Strategy (username and password), JWT Strategy (token-based authentication), and OAuth strategies like Google or GitHub login.


Installation:
    Local strategy: npm install express express-session passport passport-local bcrypt
    JWT strategy: npm install passport-jwt jsonwebtoken
    OAuth: Google or GitHub
        Google: npm install passport-google-oauth20
        GitHub: npm install passport-github2


| Strategy | Password | Session | Token | Third-party |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Local    | ✅      | ✅      | ❌    | ❌         |
| JWT      | ❌      | ❌      | ✅    | ❌         |
| Google   | ❌      | ✅      | ❌    | ✅         |
| GitHub   | ❌      | ✅      | ❌    | ✅         |

    Transport modes:
        Bike
        Car
        Bus
        Train

    These are:
    ❌ Not like Bike → Car → Bus → Train as levels.
    ✅ We use whichever is correct for the situation.
