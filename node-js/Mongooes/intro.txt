Mongoose ORM:
    Mongoose is an ODM (library) for Node.js that helps interact with MongoDB. 
    It is not part of MongoDB itself.

    Mongoose is a tool that helps us interact with MongoDB using JavaScript 
    objects instead of writing raw database queries.

    Raw database queries mean using the database’s original query language directly.
    Raw queries are like cooking from scratch, while an ORM is like using 
    ready-made masala.

Relational Database → SQL databases
Non-Relational Database → MongoDB
Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapper) used to work with MongoDB.

SQL Raw Queries (Relational DB):
    SELECT:
        -- Get all users
        SELECT * FROM users;

        -- Get users older than 18
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;

    INSERT:
        INSERT INTO users (name, email, age)
        VALUES ('Ajay', 'ajay@gmail.com', 22);

    UPDATE:
        UPDATE users
        SET age = 23
        WHERE name = 'Ajay';

    DELETE:
        DELETE FROM users
        WHERE age < 18;

MongoDB Raw Queries (Non-relational DB):
    SELECT:
        // Get all users
        db.users.find();

        // Get users older than 18
        db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 18 } });

    INSERT:
        db.users.insertOne({ name: "Ajay", email: "ajay@gmail.com", age: 22 });

    UPDATE:
        db.users.updateOne(
        { name: "Ajay" },
        { $set: { age: 23 } }
        );

    DELETE:
        db.users.deleteOne({ name: "Ajay" });
