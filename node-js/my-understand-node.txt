👤 What is a CLIENT?

A client is who asks for something.
Examples of clients:
    Your browser (Chrome, Edge)
    Mobile apps (Instagram, WhatsApp)
    Postman
    Another Node.js program

👉 Client’s job:
    Send request
    Receive response
    Show it to user


🖥️ What is a SERVER?

A server is who listens and responds.
👉 Server’s job:
    Wait for requests
    Process logic
    Send response back
    Your Node.js app is the server.


^Client = asker
^Server = giver



| Real Life      | Computer World |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| You (customer) | User           |
| Waiter         | Client         |
| Kitchen        | Server         |
| Order          | Request        |
| Food           | Response       |


✅ Now your YouTube example:
You (user) type something in the YouTube search bar (client).
The client sends the search request to the YouTube server.
The server processes the request and sends back matching videos.
The client shows those videos on the screen.

🧠 Final Simple Definition (Easy to Remember):
🧍 User
    A human
    Uses an app or browser

💻 Client
    Browser / app / search bar
    Sends requests
    Displays responses

🖥️ Server
    Always running
    Receives requests
    Processes logic
    Sends responses


🔥 One-line Memory Trick
    Client asks → Server works → Client shows

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE:
import http from "http";

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
    res.end("Hello from Server!");
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Server running at http://localhost:3000");
});

LINE BY LINE EXPLAINATION:

🔹 Line 1: import http from "http";
👉 You are importing Node.js’s built-in HTTP module
“Node.js, I want to create a web server, so give me the HTTP tools.”    
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 

🔹 Line 2: http.createServer((req, res) => { ... })
👉 This line creates a server.
req (request)
Comes from the client (browser)

Contains:
    URL
    method (GET, POST)
    headers

res (response)
Sent from the server to the client

Used to:
    send status code
    send data
end the response

📌 Think like this:
req = question
res = answer
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

🔹 Line 3: res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
👉 This line is VERY important.
Let’s break it fully.

✅ 200 — What does it mean?
200 is an HTTP Status Code

It means:
✅ “Everything is OK. Request was successful.”

Common status codes:
Code	  Meaning
200	    OK (success)
404	    Page not found
500	    Server error
403	    Forbidden

So here:
res.writeHead(200)

Means:
“Hey browser, I handled your request successfully.”

✅ { "Content-Type": "text/plain" }
This is called response headers
It tells the browser:
    “What type of data am I sending?”
    text/plain -->> Means simple text
    Not HTML
    Not JSON

Examples:
"Hello from Server!" → text/plain
<h1>Hello</h1> → text/html
{ name: "Ram" } → application/json

So this line together means:
“Response is successful (200) and I’m sending plain text.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

🔹 Line 4: res.end("Hello from Server!");
❓ Is res.end() compulsory?
👉 YES. 100% compulsory
Why?
Because:
    It sends the response
    It closes the connection
    Without it → browser will keep waiting

Think like phone call 📞:
res.write() → speaking
res.end() → hanging up the call

So this line means:
“Here is the final response. I’m done.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

🔹 Line 6: server.listen(3000, () => { ... })
This tells the server:
    “Start listening for requests.”

✅ What is 3000?
3000 is a PORT number

What is a port?
    A port is like a door number in your computer.
    Your computer = house 🏠
    Port = door 🚪
    Server listens behind that door

So:
server.listen(3000)

Means:
“Server, open door number 3000 and wait for requests.”

❓Can we give any number?
✔ Yes, mostly.
Valid port range:
1024 – 65535 (safe to use)

Common ports:

3000 → Node.js apps
8080 → Dev servers
80 → HTTP (default)
443 → HTTPS (secure)
So yes, you can use:

3000, 4000, 5000, 8080
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

🔹 Line 7: console.log("Server running at http://localhost:3000");
This line is only for YOU (developer)

It:
Prints a message in terminal
Helps you know server is running
NOT sent to browser

✅ What is http://localhost:3000?

Let’s break it:

http://
    Protocol
    Rules for communication

localhost
    Means your own computer
    Same as 127.0.0.1

3000
    Port where server is running
    So this means:
    “Open browser and go to my computer, port 3000.”
